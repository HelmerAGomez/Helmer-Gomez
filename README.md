## Project 1

The first programming language that I learned was Python. Project 1 is the Final project of my introductory class. In this project, I was given an XML file and had to read the data and store it in a parallel array to display the corresponding plant information without the use of libraries. The information was sorted from the plant's full name, zone, light, and price. It was my first time reading and storing information in a format I was unfamiliar with, and after accomplishing it, I feel much more comfortable solving similar problems. It gave me a better understanding of how to read and store information.

## Project 2

Project 2 simulates the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle with 3 "blocks" (characters  A, B, & C) and uses character vectors. The goal of the game is to get the three letters in alphabetical order into the third row. This was one of the first games that I wrote in my free time in C++. It was initially challenging to remember the C++ syntax as I was used to the Python syntax. This was a very rewarding experience once I was able to run the program without errors.
