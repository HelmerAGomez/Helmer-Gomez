## Project 1

The first programming language that I learned was Python. Project 1 is the Final project of my introductory class. In this project, I was given an XML file and had to read the data and store it in a parallel array to display the corresponding plant information without the use of libraries. The information was sorted from the plant's full name, zone, light, and price. It was my first time reading and storing information in a format I was unfamiliar with, and after accomplishing it, I feel much more comfortable solving similar problems. It gave me a better understanding of how to read and store information.
